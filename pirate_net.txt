Tonights goal: Network the CYBERDECK MK1.0 / Pi400 with an attatched piratebox RPI0w 

LLM OUTPUT:

PirateBox is an offline file-sharing and communications system built with free software and inexpensive hardware. It allows people to exchange files and communicate without the need for an Internet connection.

To upload files to a PirateBox through a Linux terminal, follow these steps:

Connect to the PirateBox's Wi-Fi network. The SSID is usually something like "PirateBox - Share Freely."

Find the IP address of the PirateBox. It's typically set to 192.168.77.1 by default, but you can check the PirateBox documentation or the network settings on your device to confirm.

Install an FTP client, if you don't have one already. A popular command-line FTP client is "lftp." You can install it on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems with:

sql
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lftp
Launch the FTP client and connect to the PirateBox. Replace "192.168.77.1" with the actual IP address of the PirateBox if it's different:
arduino
Copy code
lftp ftp://192.168.77.1
Navigate to the "Shared" folder within the PirateBox, where files are usually stored:
bash
Copy code
cd Shared
To upload a file, use the "put" command followed by the local file path. For example, to upload a file called "example.txt" from your home directory, you would run:
arduino
Copy code
put ~/example.txt
Once the file transfer is complete, you can exit the FTP client with the "exit" command:
bash
Copy code
exit
